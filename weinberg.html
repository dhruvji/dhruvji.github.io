        <p><em>tldr: summary of my final paper for <a href="https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2024-Fall-HISTORY-158D-001-LEC-001">hist 158D</a>; people ignoring systemic vulnerabilities in analysis of interwar Germany</em></p>
        <p>World War I left Germany reeling: humiliated, economically wrecked, and territorially diminished. Into this chaos stepped Adolf Hitler, whose ideological ambitions and calculated foreign policy reshaped Europe and triggered World War II. Gerhard Weinberg's <em>The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany</em> offers a deep dive into Hitler’s decisions between 1933-1939, portraying him as a master strategist whose actions set the stage for war. However, Weinberg’s analysis has its blind spots—primarily in overlooking how systemic vulnerabilities allowed Hitler’s rise in the first place.</p>
        <p>Weinberg paints a detailed picture of Hitler as someone who blended opportunistic tactics with long-term goals. He shows how Hitler exploited weaknesses in diplomacy and leveraged Germany’s internal cohesion for external aggression. For example, the Anschluss with Austria wasn’t just a lucky grab; it was a mix of calculated pressure, covert manipulation, and the exploitation of Austria’s resources for German rearmament. But Weinberg narrowly focuses on Hitler’s agency, downplaying how the unresolved consequences of World War I—like economic instability, territorial losses, and national humiliation—created fertile ground for fascism.</p>
        <p>This oversight shows up again in Weinberg’s discussion of key moments, like the Sudeten Crisis and the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact. He emphasizes Hitler’s ability to outmaneuver British and French appeasement but doesn’t fully explore why the West miscalculated. Britain’s reluctance to challenge Germany, for instance, stemmed from a recognition that the Treaty of Versailles had been overly punitive—something Hitler weaponized in his propaganda. Similarly, the Non-Aggression Pact wasn’t just a tactical win for Hitler; it reflected a world where systemic distrust and fractured alliances made bold, aggressive moves more viable.</p>
        <p>Weinberg’s strongest contributions lie in his analysis of how domestic and foreign policies intertwined. Hitler’s consolidation of internal power, from the Night of the Long Knives to his economic rearmament strategy, made his aggressive foreign ambitions possible. Weinberg rightly argues that Germany’s military-industrial growth, coupled with psychological dominance over Europe, emboldened Hitler. Yet, even here, the focus on Hitler’s choices misses how structural factors—like the economic devastation of the Weimar Republic—shaped those choices and made them effective.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, Weinberg offers a compelling narrative of Hitler as a driver of war, but his narrow lens risks making the rise of Nazism feel inevitable. By centering on Hitler’s strategies, he underemphasized the systemic vulnerabilities—political fragmentation, economic despair, and international indecision—that enabled Hitler’s vision to take root. To truly understand how Germany reached the brink of war, one must look beyond the man at the helm and into the cracks in the system that allowed him to steer the ship.</p>
